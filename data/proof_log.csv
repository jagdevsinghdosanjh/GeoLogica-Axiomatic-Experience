Let’s consider two distinct lines: Line  𝐿1 and Line 𝐿2
Step 2: Suppose they have two points in common
Assume that 𝐿1  and 𝐿2 intersect at two distinct points, say: Point 𝐴 Point 𝐵
Step 3: Use the definition of a line
In Euclidean geometry, a line is uniquely determined by any two distinct points. So, if both 𝐴 and 𝐵 lie on 𝐿1, then:
𝐿1 is the unique line passing through 𝐴 and 𝐵
Similarly, since both 𝐴 and 𝐵 lie on 𝐿2, then:
𝐿2 is also the unique line passing through 𝐴 and 𝐵
Step 4: Conclude that the lines must be the same
Since both lines pass through the same two distinct points, and a line is uniquely determined by two points: 𝐿1=𝐿2
But this contradicts our assumption that 𝐿1 and 𝐿2 are distinct.
Step 5: Final conclusion
Therefore, our assumption that two distinct lines can have more than one point in common must be false.
✅ Hence, two distinct lines cannot have more than one point in common.
